## VueJS 1.x Bindings

- Put bindings for VueJS here; though cannot use standalone; so not exported
- Needs to be used for example together with the VueJS BabbageUI Demo
- See repo https://github.com/leowmjw/vue-babbageui-demo for demo
- NOTE: Is NOT backwards compatible with VueJ 2.x; there is use of vm.$dispatch an vm.$broadcast which will be deprecated in VueJS 2.x
